I completed my internship at a reputed Chartered Accountancy (CA) firm, where I gained practical experience in accounting and financial operations. I was involved in tasks such as GST filing, voucher entry, invoice management, and maintaining records using Tally. I also assisted in preparing financial reports and supported the team with client data analysis. This internship helped me develop a solid understanding of accounting principles, improved my attention to detail, and strengthened my communication and teamwork skills in a professional environment.
